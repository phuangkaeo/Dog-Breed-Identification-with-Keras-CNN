# Dog-Breed-Identification-with-Keras-CNN
# Context of the project
You join a startup that is working on a Computer Vision tool to automatically detect a dog's breed from a simple photo. Your mission is to carry out a first POC with Google Collab: https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb?utm_source=scs-index#recent=true or Kaggle in order to have access to a GPU.

In addition to this, you need to know more about it.

Before you start it is necessary to find the state of the art of image classification (see Papers With Codes) and to see that they are the best models accessible directly in Keras, TF or PyTorch.

It will be necessary to follow the learning quality of your model. Evolution of the LOSS knew the train, on the test, the overall accuracy of your model and the accuracy by classes in order to identify the "Why 'your model is wrong.

In addition to this, you need to know more about it.
